# Sales-call-analysis
This project analyzes a sales call by downloading YouTube audio, transcribing it with OpenAIâ€™s Whisper, and calculating talk-time ratio, question count, longest monologue, and sentiment. It provides actionable insights, runs in Google Colab, handles poor audio, and outputs a quick summary to improve sales rep performance.
